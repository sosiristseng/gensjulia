## Graph data types

See the [[graph]] theory section.

## Numeric data types

- https://github.com/cjdoris/Infinity.jl : Representation of infinity in Julia.
- https://github.com/JuliaArrays/CustomUnitRanges.jl : This Julia package supports the creation of array types with "unconventional" indices.
- https://github.com/JuliaGeometry/Quaternions.jl : Quaternions, octonions and dual-quaternions for 3D rotational orientation.
- https://github.com/JuliaGraphics/Measures.jl : Unified measure and coordinates types.
- https://github.com/JuliaMath/FixedPointNumbers.jl : This library exports [fixed-point number](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-point_arithmetic) types.

### Intervals

[Julia intervals](https://juliaintervals.github.io/)

- https://github.com/baggepinnen/MonteCarloMeasurements.jl : Error propagation using Monte-Carlo simulation. Similar to `Measurements.jl`, but more accurate for highly nonlinear functions at the expense of longer execution time.
- https://github.com/juliaintervals/intervalarithmetic.jl : Rigorous floating-point calculations using interval arithmetic in Julia.
- https://github.com/JuliaPhysics/Measurements.jl : Error propagation calculator and library. It supports real and complex numbers with uncertainty, arbitrary precision calculations, and operations with arrays.

### Floating-point numbers

- https://github.com/cjdoris/LogarithmicNumbers.jl : A [logarithmic number system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithmic_number_system) for Julia. Provides the signed `ULogarithmic` and unsigned `Logarithmic` types for representing real numbers on a logarithmic scale.
- https://github.com/JeffreySarnoff/ArbNumerics.jl : extended precision math, accurate and performant
- https://github.com/JuliaMath/BFloat16s.jl : This package defines the [BFloat16 data type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bfloat16_floating-point_format). The only currently available hardware implementation of this datatype are Google's [Cloud TPUs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_processing_unit).
- https://github.com/JuliaMath/DecFP.jl : The package provides 32-bit, 64-bit, and 128-bit binary-encoded decimal floating-point types following the IEEE 754-2008, implemented as a wrapper around the (BSD-licensed) [Intel Decimal Floating-Point Math Library](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/tool/intel-decimal-floating-point-math-library.html).

- https://github.com/andyferris/Dictionaries.jl : An alternative interface for dictionaries in Julia, for improved productivity and performance.
- https://github.com/charleskawczynski/DispatchedTuples.jl : `Dispatched Tuples` are like immutable dictionaries (so, they're technically more like `NamedTuples`) except that the keys are instances of types. Also, because DispatchedTuples are backed by tuples, they are GPU-friendly.
- https://github.com/jonniedie/ConcreteStructs.jl : `@concrete` can be used to make non-concrete structs concrete without the boilerplate of adding type parameters.
- https://github.com/mauro3/SimpleTraits.jl : Simple [Traits](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/2345#issuecomment-54537633) for Julia
- https://github.com/scheinerman/Bijections.jl : Bijection datatype for Julia that blocks assigning the same value to two different keys.
- https://github.com/synchronoustechnologies/TypeParams.jl : keeping compile-time type information in `struct` for better performance.

### Accessing elements

- https://github.com/devmotion/SimpleUnPack.jl : Lightweight Julia macro for destructuring properties and fields. (Requires Julia >= 1.7)
- https://github.com/JuliaObjects/Accessors.jl : updating immutable data simple. It is the successor of https://github.com/jw3126/Setfield.jl.
- https://github.com/mauro3/Parameters.jl : Types with default field values, keyword constructors and (un-)pack macros.
- https://github.com/mauro3/UnPack.jl : `@unpack` some or all of the fields of a type, and `@pack`, in the case of mutable data types.
