title: Audio and Video Processing
---

## Organization

- [Julia Audio](https://github.com/JuliaAudio)
- [Julia Music](https://github.com/JuliaMusic)

## Audio

- https://github.com/dpsanders/MusicTheory.jl : provide a Julian interface for representing the objects and structures in ("Western") music theory (based on semitones).

### Audio files IO

- https://github.com/dancasimiro/WAV.jl : Julia package for working with [WAV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAV) files.
- https://github.com/JuliaAudio/LibSndFile.jl : A wrapper for [libsndfile](http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/), and supports [a wide variety](http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/) of file and sample formats.
- https://github.com/JuliaIO/FLAC.jl : Julia bindings for libFLAC.
- https://github.com/JuliaMusic/MIDI.jl : A Julia library for reading and writing Midi files.
- https://github.com/staticfloat/Opus.jl : Julia library to interface with [Opus](https://www.opus-codec.org/) audio files.

### Audio processing

- https://github.com/bramtayl/Justly.jl : compose and play music using any pitches you want.
- https://github.com/fundamental/OpenSoundControl.jl : Open Sound Control serialization library, a port of [RTOSC](https://github.com/fundamental/rtosc) for Julia.
- https://github.com/JuliaAudio/PortAudio.jl : Julia interface API for the [PortAudio](http://www.portaudio.com/) library for cross-platform access to audio devices.
- https://github.com/JuliaAudio/SampledSignals.jl : Core types for regularly-sampled multichannel signals like Audio, RADAR and Software-Defined Radio.
- https://github.com/JuliaMusic/Mplay.jl : A Julia MIDI Mixer / Player with an OpenGL based GUI.
- https://github.com/JuliaMusic/MusicManipulations.jl : Manipulate music data, humanize, quantize and analyze music performances with Julia.
- https://github.com/JuliaMusic/MusicProcessing.jl : Music Processing Library in Julia inspired by [librosa](https://librosa.org/doc/latest/index.html).
- https://github.com/JuliaMusic/MusicVisualizations.jl : Providing music-related visualization built on top of the packages of JuliaMusic.

### Resources

- [Using faust in Julia](https://faustdoc.grame.fr/tutorials/julia/) : `faust` is a functional programming language for sound synthesis and audio processing.

## Videos

- https://github.com/JuliaIO/FFMPEG.jl : Julia Package for the FFMPEG builder binaries.
- https://github.com/JuliaIO/VideoIO.jl : Reading and writing of video files in Julia via `FFMPEG.jl`.
