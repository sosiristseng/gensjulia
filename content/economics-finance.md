> Economics and Finance are part of [Actuarial science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actuarial_science)

- [Quantitative economic modelling](https://quantecon.org) lecture series in Julia language, designed and written by Thomas J. Sargent and John Stachurski.
- [Julia Quant](https://github.com/JuliaQuant) organization.

## Econometrics

[Wikipedia: Econometrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Econometrics)

- [ARCHModels.jl](https://github.com/s-broda/ARCHModels.jl) : A Julia package for estimating [ARMA-GARCH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_conditional_heteroskedasticity) models.
- [Dolo.jl](https://github.com/EconForge/Dolo.jl) : A tool to describe and solve economic models.
- [DSGE.jl](https://github.com/FRBNY-DSGE/DSGE.jl) : Solve and estimate Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium models (including the New York Fed DSGE).
- [Dynare.jl](https://github.com/DynareJulia/Dynare.jl) : A Julia rewrite of Dynare: solving, simulating and estimating DSGE models.
- [Expectations.jl](https://github.com/QuantEcon/Expectations.jl) : Expectation operators for `Distributions.jl` objects.
- [FredData.jl](https://github.com/micahjsmith/FredData.jl) : Pull [data](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/) from [FRED](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Economic_Data) directly into Julia.
- [QuantEcon.jl](https://github.com/QuantEcon/QuantEcon.jl) :Julia implementation of [QuantEcon](https://quantecon.org/quantecon-jl/) routines.
- [SchumakerSpline.jl](https://github.com/s-baumann/SchumakerSpline.jl) : An equivalent Julia package to R's [schumaker](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/schumaker/index.html) to create a shape preserving spline that quickly and smoothly converges to a fixed point in economic dynamics problems including value function iteration.
- [SolveDSGE.jl](https://github.com/RJDennis/SolveDSGE.jl) : a Julia package for solving Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) models.

## Finance

- [Currencies.jl](https://github.com/JuliaFinance/Currencies.jl) :  Simple checked fixed-point currencies for Julia.
- [InterestRates.jl](https://github.com/felipenoris/InterestRates.jl) : Tools for Term Structure of Interest Rates calculation, aimed at the valuation of financial contracts, specially Fixed Income instruments, indexing and Term Structures.
- [InterestRates.jl](https://github.com/JuliaFinance/BusinessDays.jl) : A highly optimized Business Days calculator written in Julia language. Also known as Working Days calculator.
- [MarketData.jl](https://github.com/JuliaQuant/MarketData.jl) : Time series market data
- [Timestamps.jl](https://github.com/JuliaQuant/Timestamps.jl) : Immutable timestamped values.
